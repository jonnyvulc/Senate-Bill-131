[Approved by Governor July 10, 2023. Filed with Secretary of
State July 10, 2023.]
legislative counsel’s digest
SB 131, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review. Taxation.
(1) Existing law requires the Controller to state an account with persons
that receive funds or property belonging to the state and fail to properly
render account thereof to the state, and persons that fail to pay to the State
Treasury any money belonging to the state. Existing law requires the
Controller to offset delinquent accounts against personal income tax refunds
that have been certified by the Franchise Tax Board, subject to a specified
priority. Existing law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
2024, prohibits the Controller from offsetting delinquent accounts against
the personal income tax refunds of an individual who received the earned
income tax credit or the young child tax credit for the taxable year, except
as specified.
This bill would additionally prohibit the Controller from offsetting
delinquent accounts against the personal income tax refunds of an individual
who received the foster youth tax credit.
(2) Existing law requires the Department of Finance to report annually,
no later than September 15, to the Legislature with regard to tax
expenditures, as defined. Existing law requires the report to include specified
information, including, for personal income tax expenditures, the number
of taxpayers affected and returns filed, as applicable, for the most recent
tax year for which full year data is available.
Commencing August 1, 2023, this bill would instead require the report
to be provided to the Legislature no later than November 1 of each year and
would change the contents of the report by instead requiring, for personal
income tax expenditures and for the most recent tax year for which full year
data is available, the number of taxpayers affected and returns filed,
categorized by taxpayers’ income levels, as applicable, and the cost to the
state resulting from these personal income tax expenditures, categorized by
the taxpayers’ income levels, for which data is readily available.
96
(3) Existing law, the Personal Income Tax Law, in partial conformity
with federal income tax law, imposes a tax on the taxable income of estates
or of any kind of property held in trust. That law provides the taxable income
of an estate or trust is computed in the same manner as in the case of an
individual, except as provided, and the tax is paid by the fiduciary of the
trust or estate. Existing law provides that, where the grantor or another
person is treated as the owner of any portion of the trust, known as a “grantor
trust,” then items of income, deductions, and credits against tax of the trust
are included in computing the taxable income and credits of the grantor or
other owner.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, would
include the income of an incomplete gift nongrantor trust, as defined, in the
gross income of the grantor to the extent the income of the trust would be
taken into account in computing the grantor’s taxable income if the trust
were treated as a grantor trust. The bill would provide that these provisions
do not apply where certain conditions are met, including an irrevocable
election made by the fiduciary to be taxed as a resident nongrantor trust, as
provided.
(4) The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law, in
conformity with federal income tax law, generally defines “gross income”
as income from whatever source derived, except as specifically excluded,
and provides various exclusions from gross income.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020,
and before January 1, 2028, provide exclusions from gross income for any
qualified taxpayer, as defined, for amounts received in settlements associated
with either the 2019 Kincade Fire in the County of Sonoma, or the 2020
Zogg Fire in the Counties of Tehama and Shasta, as provided.
(5) The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow
various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws, including, for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2026, a
credit for hiring qualified full-time employees, as defined, within a
designated census tract or economic development area in an amount equal
to 35% of the qualified wages paid to those employees multiplied by the
applicable percentage for that taxable year. That law requires a taxpayer
claiming the credit to request a tentative credit reservation from the Franchise
Tax Board within 30 days of complying with specified new hire reporting
requirements.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2023,
and before January 1, 2026, eliminate the requirement that the new
employment be located within a designated census tract or economic
development area if the qualified taxpayer is engaged in semiconductor
manufacturing or semiconductor research and development, lithium
production, manufacturing of lithium batteries, or electric airplane
manufacturing, as defined, and self-certifies and verifies compliance with
specified requirements. The bill would, for each taxable year beginning on
or after January 1, 2023, and before January 1, 2024, allow a qualified
taxpayer engaged in semiconductor manufacturing, semiconductor research
96
— 2 —
Ch. 55
and development, lithium production, manufacturing of lithium batteries,
or electric airplane manufacturing to request a tentative credit reservation
from the Franchise Tax Board on or before the last day of the month
following the close of the taxable year for which the credit is claimed, instead
of within 30 days of complying with specified new hire reporting
requirements.
(6) Existing law establishes the State Department of Social Services and
requires the department to administer various public social services
programs, such as the CalFood Program and the In-Home Supportive
Services Program. Existing law also establishes the State Department of
Health Care Services within the California Health and Human Services
Agency, and sets forth the department’s powers and duties relating to, among
other things, public health, licensing and certification of certain health
facilities, and the state Medi-Cal program.
Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services and the
State Department of Health Care Services to exchange data with the
Franchise Tax Board, including the names, addresses, and contact
information of individuals that may qualify for the California EITC, and
requires all data provided to remain confidential and be used only for
purposes directly connected with the federal and the California EITC, and
other federal and state antipoverty tax credits.
Existing law authorizes the Franchise Tax Board to disclose individual
income tax return information for taxable years beginning on or after January
1, 2020, and before January 1, 2022, to the State Department of Social
Services and the State Department of Health Care Services, and requires
the data provided to remain confidential and be used only for purposes of
informing state residents of the availability of the V olunteer Income Tax
Assistance (VITA), CalFile, the federal EITC, the California EITC, and
other federal and state antipoverty tax credits that are designed to alleviate
poverty and tax burdens of low-income households. That law makes the
unauthorized disclosure or use of information shared in this way a
misdemeanor.
This bill would extend the authorization of the Franchise Tax Board to
disclose individual income tax return information to include information
for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and before January
1, 2026. By expanding the crimes established by these provisions until
January 1, 2026, this bill would establish a state-mandated local program.
(7) Existing federal and California income tax laws allow various credits
against the taxes imposed by those laws, including, among other antipoverty
tax credits, a refundable federal earned income tax credit (EITC) for certain
low-income individuals who have earned income and who meet certain
other requirements and a California EITC, in partial conformity with federal
income tax laws, that is equal to that portion of the federal EITC as
determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor.
Existing law, the Earned Income Tax Credit Information Act, requires
an employer, as defined, to notify all employees that they may be eligible
for the federal and the California EITC, as specified. That law also requires
96
Ch. 55 — 3 —
specified state agencies to notify recipients of state services that they may
be eligible for the federal and the California EITC. Existing law provides
the form and manner of notification by employers and state agencies.
This bill would recast these notification requirements to require
notification of the availability of specified income tax filing assistance
programs and state and federal antipoverty tax credits, including the federal
and the California EITC. The bill would also rephrase the form of the
notification, and would require employers to notify employees twice
annually, as provided.
(8) Existing law, the Better for Families Act, requires the Franchise Tax
Board to make a one-time Better for Families Tax Refund payment to each
qualified recipient, as defined, of an applicable amount, as specified, in the
form and manner determined by the Franchise Tax Board.
This bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to issue these payments
no later than September 30, 2023, except as provided.
(9) Existing law requires a bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to
contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives the
tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data
collection requirements.
This bill would include additional information required for any bill
authorizing a new tax expenditure.
(10) This bill would include a change in state statute that would result
in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article
XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage
the approval of 2⁄3 of the membership of each house of the Legislature.
(11) The bill would make legislative findings and declarations regarding
the public purpose served by this bill.
(12) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local
agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory
provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for
a specified reason.
(13) This bill would, for the 2023–2024 fiscal year, appropriate the sum
of $10,000, from the General Fund to the Franchise Tax Board for purposes
of administering the above-described tax credit for hiring qualified full-time
employees.
(14) The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill
providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
Appropriation: yes.

eligible persons who participate in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit
program, hundreds of millions of federal dollars go unclaimed by the
working poor in California.

amplify the poverty-reducing effects of the federal EITC for the poorest
working Californians.

families, to enhance the wages and income of working poor persons and
families, to ensure that California taxpayers receive their share of the federal
money available in the federal EITC program and other state and federal

access the additional California EITC, and to inject additional federal money
into the California economy, the state shall facilitate the furnishing of

that they may claim those credits on their federal and state income tax
returns.
